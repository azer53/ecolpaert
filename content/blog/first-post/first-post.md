# From Hugo to Gatsby

> “There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.”

Above quote is a quote by ― *F. Scott Fitzgerald*, author of the Great Gatsby book. And it's a brief conclusion of the question why Gatsby or why Hugo as a static site generator. In my opinion both are doing quite well and have a good documentation, support and easy learning curve. Currently I'm still hosting my first Hugo blogging starter on Netlify. After gaining a basic understanding of Hugo I moved to Gatsby, merely to learn the differences. I chose Hugo in the first place because it didn't require any knowledge of React. Afterwards i did choose Gatsby because it was heavily dependent on React.


### Netlify deployment

This was my most easy choice, why?

* It popped up everywhere on my Twitter, every web developer seemed to be using it
* The JAM-stack was an item on my to-do list for a very long time
* GitHub integration
* Free of charge for experiments like this
* Possibility of A/B testing in the future
* [Functions](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/) - Lambda functions on Netlify


### Future steps

* Write more about the tech-journey
* [Explore Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) - a headless open-source CMS
* Proper UI tooling, for now I'm using a basic beginner theme
* Write my first Lambda/Netlify functions
